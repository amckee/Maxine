This is the very beginnings of a project designed to handle all the things I would like to add to the Raspberry Pi in my vehicle.

It will include OBD inputs to generate sound in real time (for giggles), custom security, sound fx for various events, theme music for events, smart ass backseat driver comments for GPS, and so much more.

Currently there isn't much. This is really just to tie in my dev area on the Pi itself to the corresponding git repo.

Stay tuned! Or don't, I don't care. This is for me.
