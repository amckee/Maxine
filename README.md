This is a project designed to handle all the things I would like to add to the Raspberry Pi in my vehicle.

It will include OBD inputs to generate sound in real time, custom security, sound fx for various events, theme music for events, smart ass backseat driver comments for GPS, and so much more.

Using https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD.git for the OBD backend, 'cause it rocks.

Currently there isn't much. This is really just to tie in my dev area on the Pi itself to the corresponding git repo.

Stay tuned! Or don't, I don't care. This is for me.

Licensing: I haven't picked one yet, so for now it's a generic 'Do what you want, but do not blame me. I told you not to.'
